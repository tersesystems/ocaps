- @ref:[Brand](examples/dynamic_seal.md) for sealing and unsealing capabilities
- @ref:[RevocableMembrane](examples/membrane.md) for revocation as an effect.
- Macros for @ref:[composition](examples/composition.md), @ref:[attenuation](examples/attenuation.md), @ref:[revocable](examples/revocation.md) and @ref:[modulating](examples/modulation.md) capabilities.
