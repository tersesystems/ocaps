# Examples

This is a series of examples showing capabilities in action.

## Overview

This section shows creation of capabilities and direct use.

* [Overview](overview.md)

## Structural Patterns

This section shows structural patterns that do not change behavior.

* [Composition](composition.md)
* [Attenuation](attenuation.md)

## Behavioral Patterns

This section shows patterns that change the behavior of capabilities, typically adding side effects or blocking execution completely.

* [Modulation](modulation.md)
* [Revocation](revocation.md)

## Operational Patterns

This section shows capabilities used together or passed around.

* [Amplification](amplification.md)
* [Delegation](delegation.md)
* [Gatekeeper](gatekeeper.md)

## Confinement Patterns

This section shows capabilities being rendered inaccessible or made accessible through a membrane.
